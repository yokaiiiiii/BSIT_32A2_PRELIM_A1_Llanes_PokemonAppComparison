The `index.html` file is the starting point for a React app. It sets up the basic structure of the page but doesn’t include any UI elements or specific functionality. React handles the UI and components dynamically.

In contrast, `test.html` is a standalone page with its own UI for searching Pokémon. The `script.js` file in `test.html` fetches Pokémon data from an API and updates the UI directly. To use this in a React app, `script.js` would need to be rewritten. The logic for fetching data and updating the UI would be moved into React components, using React’s state management.

For styling, `test.html` uses `styles.css`, but in React, styling is typically handled within components using methods like inline styles, CSS modules, or styled-components.
